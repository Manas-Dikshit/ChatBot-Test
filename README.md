🤖 Chatbot Test Repository

Welcome to the Chatbot-test repository!

This repo is for collecting and testing individual chatbot projects from our team.
Each teammate will work on their own branch, and the main branch will remain clean for the final combined version.

📌 Workflow

Fork this repository to your GitHub account.

Create your own branch with your name (e.g., alice-chatbot, bob-chatbot).

Upload your chatbot code into your branch (using GitHub → Add file → Upload files).

Open a Pull Request from your branch → into this repo → main branch.

I will review and merge your code into a separate branch inside this repo.

📂 Branching Rules

main → Must stay clean (no direct uploads).

<yourname>-chatbot → Your personal branch for your chatbot code.

⚠️ Important Notes

Do not upload directly to main.

Always use a unique branch name with your name (e.g., john-chatbot).

If you need to update your code, commit changes to your branch, not main.

✅ This way, everyone’s chatbot stays separate, and we can later review or merge into main when needed.
